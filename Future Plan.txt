My future plans.

Hello my friends. Welcome back to my homework video. Today i will tell you about my future plans. So what are your future plans? 

And for me, i wonder that what are my future plans? The only thing i attention now is going to complete my major skill because i'am in the final year of university,  I am run out of time to waste , i'am going to graduate in next year So i must accomplish my job skill. 
At the moment, i'am a trainee in a small company /ˈkəmpənē/ and my work is web programming. 
Obviously, i love my major! But i have some trouble. I really stupid, i'm not smart in work. So that's why i need to master my major skill so much. I work hard day by day and accumulate /ә'kju:mjuleit/ (tích lũy) my experiences. 
My company has a lot of clever people and they just same age /āj/ to me but they have more experiences than me. I hope i can gain a lot of knowledge from them. 
Right now, i will try my best to achieve my plan.

My parents always remind me find a girlfriend and they want me get married earliest i can. They dont't want to see me get married when i old like my brother and my sister. But i don't worry about that. For me, girlfriend or get married is not important than i have a job. When i can find a job, i can take care of myself and my parents, after that, i will find a girlfriend. i think its really fine!

Beside, i also study english very hard. I need to improve my listen skill also my speak skill. English is necessary for my job. In work, i need to search a lot of method and specialized knowledge. All most are english. So i need english to complete my work. 

That are my plans. So It's not so much.
