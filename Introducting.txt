Hi everyone. Today, I’m very happy to tell you a little bit about myself. My name is Ngoc and you can call me Ngoc Ngao Ngo. 

Now, i'am turning 20 years old this year.

Firstly, i was born and grew up a small village in the northwest of Hung Yen province. It is a peaceful village which is famous for Nhan Long and Te cake. 

At the moment, I am in the final year of university. I'm studing Information Technology in HaNoi university of industry. 

I have learnt English for 10 years, but my speaking skill is not good enough. Nowadays, English is the most inportant languages, if i can speak english fluently, i can find a good job with a high salary. Therefore, I try my best to study hard and I hope I can speak it better when I join this class.

In my free time, I have passion for listening to music. In addition (/ə'diʃn/), I also like reading books, going running. I spend almost time at weekend to "chew" my books

That all about myself. Thank you for watching!
