-- what should we do when learning in university?

Congratulation /kən,grætju'leiʃn/ if you are studying in university. You're so lucky than many other people. So, do you have any problem when you study in university?. For me, study in university is a fight i need to win. 

So, what should we do when learning in university?

In my opinion,..
1. (Manage time). I think when we are studying in university, we need to manage /'mænidʤ/ your time by creating a timetable. University is very different from high school because you need to study a lot of knowledge. That so terrible if you can't controll your time. Management your time help you avoid wasted time, work effectively /i'fektivli/ and you can spend your time to study a lot of new things. 

2. (Part time job). Next, i think we should find a part time job. For me, i also have a part time job. It's can not make me become a rich kid but it can help my parents does not working hard. Let find a part time job instead of wasted time for sleeping or playing game online. Part time job not only useful for yourself but also help your parents so much. Beside, it help you improve your survival skills and make you feel the value of money which parents give you each month. 

3. (Teamwork). Teamwork is a necessary skill you should study, improve and develop. In university, you usually work or study in a team, study with a team, doing big homework with a team,.. . Teamwork is also important when you work on a company. Teamwork help you improve your communicate, your presentation. Teamwork make your mission easier.

4. (Study a new language). Believe me, study a new language is very very very difficult but it's not impossible. Nowaday, English become the most popular language in the world. So, study English is your best choice. As i said before, if you can communicate with other people in English, you can find a good job with a high salary,..... ... 

5. (Take part in club). You should take part in some club when you learing university. You can join in dance club, voluntery /,vɔlən'tiə/ club or music club. You can not only make friends and expand /iks'pænd/ your relationship but also improve your behavior, soft skills and your communication.
